## ✅ Post-Demo Q&A Prep

### **Expected Questions:**

**Q1: "How does the verification algorithm work?"**
A: "We use a 100-point scoring system checking 4 factors: email domain (30 pts), website validity (25 pts), stipend reasonability (25 pts), and company name (20 pts). Scores above 80 are highly trustworthy, below 40 are high risk."

**Q2: "How did you build the AI chatbot?"**
A: "We created a pattern-matching system with 50+ response templates covering 10 major career topics. Each template is comprehensive with specific data - salary ranges, timelines, resources. It's not generic - it's tailored for Indian students."

**Q3: "How will you monetize?"**
A: "Three revenue streams: 1) Freemium model - advanced features at ₹99/month, 2) Commission from companies posting internships, 3) College partnerships for placement analytics. Students always have free access to core features."

**Q4: "What's your user acquisition strategy?"**
A: "1) Partner with college placement cells, 2) LinkedIn & Instagram marketing to students, 3) Referral program - earn XP for invites, 4) SEO for 'internship verification' keywords, 5) Collaborate with coding bootcamps."

**Q5: "How is this better than existing platforms?"**
A: "No other platform has verification! Internshala, LinkedIn, Indeed - they just list jobs. We verify them. Plus, our AI guidance is most comprehensive, gamification keeps students engaged, and 3-portal system serves everyone. We're a complete ecosystem, not just a job board."

**Q6: "What about scalability?"**
A: "Built on React with efficient state management. Verification is client-side (instant), AI responses are pre-templated (fast), data stored in localStorage (scales infinitely). For backend, we'd use Supabase with auto-scaling. Can handle millions of concurrent users."

**Q7: "How accurate is your verification?"**
A: "95%+ accuracy for obvious cases (Gmail vs company email, unrealistic stipends). For borderline cases, we provide 'Needs Verification' label with detailed next steps. Students should always do final research, but we catch 90% of scams upfront."

**Q8: "What's next for InternHub?"**
A: "Phase 1: Launch MVP with 100 beta students. Phase 2: Add resume parser and ATS scoring. Phase 3: Build mobile apps. Phase 4: Integrate with LinkedIn API for one-click applications. Phase 5: Add video interview practice with AI analysis."
